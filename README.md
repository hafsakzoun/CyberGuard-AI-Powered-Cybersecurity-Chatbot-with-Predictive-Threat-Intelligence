## Short Description
CyberGuard is an advanced cybersecurity chatbot combining Language Understanding Models (LUM), Diffusion Models for threat forecasting, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver intelligent, real-time security insights. Built on a scalable microservices architecture with DevOps/MLOps integration.

## Project Overview
CyberGuard is an intelligent cybersecurity chatbot designed to handle complex security queries, provide incident responses, and assist in threat analysis. The system integrates advanced Language Understanding Models (LUM) for contextual comprehension, Diffusion Models for threat forecasting, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enriched responses. Built on a scalable microservices architecture, the project ensures high availability and maintainability, leveraging DevOps/MLOps practices for efficient deployment and operation.

## Objectives
1. **Develop a Cybersecurity-Focused Chatbot**: Intelligent response system for cybersecurity inquiries.
2. **Integrate Diffusion Models for Threat Forecasting**: Predict threat spread in network environments.
3. **Leverage Language Understanding Models (LUM)**: Use state-of-the-art models (GPT-4, BERT) for accurate user input understanding.
4. **Implement Advanced RAG**: Enhance chatbot responses with real-time data retrieval.
5. **Adopt Microservices Architecture**: Modular system design for scalability and maintainability.
6. **Apply DevOps/MLOps Practices**: Implement CI/CD, model management, and infrastructure automation.

## System Architecture

### Microservices Components
- **Language Understanding Service**: NLP engine for query comprehension.
- **Diffusion Prediction Service**: Threat forecasting using diffusion models.
- **RAG Integration Service**: Real-time data retrieval and integration.
- **Security Intelligence Service**: Access to threat databases and security advisories.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Interactive frontend for security analysts.

### DevOps/MLOps Integration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Containerization**: Docker for services, Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Model Management**: MLflow for model tracking and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform/Ansible for infrastructure provisioning.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack for observability.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
